## üìÇ Project Structure

- **Frontend**: Angular app handling the UI, visualizations, and user interactions.
- **Backend**: Node.js Express server managing authentication and thought data.
- **MongoDB**: Stores user credentials and the hierarchical thought structures.

### Key Files

#### Frontend
- `thought-organizer.component.ts`: Core logic for managing thoughts.
- `thought.service.ts`: Handles communication with the backend API.
- `login.component.ts`: Login form for authentication.

#### Backend
- `server.js`: Main entry point for the Express server.

## üíª Usage

1. **Login**:
   - Start by logging in with valid credentials. (Make sure the MongoDB database has valid users.)
   
2. **Manage Thoughts**:
   - Once logged in, you can create, edit, or delete thoughts. Link them to visualize relationships using dashed lines.
   
3. **Logout**:
   - A logout button on the top-right corner will redirect you back to the login page.

## üõ†Ô∏è Development

### Setup MongoDB

To set up the database, run MongoDB and use the following commands to create a database and add a user:

```bash
use thoughtOrganizerDB
db.users.insert({
  username: 'testuser',
  password: '<hashed_password>'
})

```

## üêû Troubleshooting

- **Authentication Issues**: Ensure that the MongoDB server is running, and user credentials are correct.
- **Connection Issues**: Check that the frontend and backend are properly connected. The backend should run on port `5000` and be accessible at `http://localhost:5000`.
- **Visualization Errors**: Ensure that the D3.js library is correctly integrated and that the thought data structure is valid.
